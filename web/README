IMPEx FMI WEB SERVICES

IMPEx-FMI-Web -- This folder contains the code of web services
provided by the Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI) in the
framework of the EU-funded FP7 IMPEx project (Integrated Medium For
Planetary Exploration, http://impex-fp7.oeaw.ac.at). These web
services provide access to HYB and GUMICS simulation data bases at
FMI's servers and give users simple interfaces to download simulation
run results with user defined parameter sets.

The present code is built into handling web services in the FMI's
server environment. It is dependent on the structure of the simulation
run database and on tools that are used to retrieve data from the
database. As such it is not applicable to direct use by other data
providers. However, it may be of interest to users who are designing
their own simulation run databases and web services which are
compatible with the IMPEx datamodel.

IMPEx DATA MODEL AND WEB SERVICES

IMPEx data model defines the rules how simulation run metadata will be
organized and stored. Technically the model is implemented as an xml
schema (http://impex-fp7.oeaw.ac.at/xsd/impex-1_0_3.xsd). Metadata for
all simulation runs of a single simulation data provider are stored in
an xml file (tree file) which must validate against the schema file.

The IMPEx Simulation Data Model is an extension of SPASE
(http://www.spase-group.org/data/dictionary/spase-2_2_2.pdf), used to
describe data coming from observations of the space physics domain. It
uses most of the elements defined in the SPASE dictionary, with
additions necessary to describe data coming from simulations.

Web services provide means of accessing the data in a simulation run
data base. The IMPEx web services are REST-compliant and are described
in WSDL language (version 1.1). The FMI's web services definition file
(Methods_FMI.wsdl) lists all services (methods) provided by FMI and is
available at http://impex-fp7.fmi.fi/ws/Methods_FMI.wsdl. The web
services supported by FMI are:

getDataPointValue
getDataPointValueSpacecraft
getSurface
getMostRelevantRun
getVOTableURL
getFieldLine
getParticleTrajectory
getDataPointSpectra
getDataPointSpectraSpacecraft
isAlive

CODE

All code is written in PHP and requires at least version 5.4. In some
methods the PHP code makes calls to tools (written in C++) that are
specially designed for HYB simulations. These are:

hcintpol  : tool to interpolate values of physical variables at given data points from a .hc file
ft        : tool to compute field lines
iontracer : tool to compute particle trajectories

These tools are included in the HYB model GitHub repository
(https://github.com/fmihpc/hyb).

In addition stilts (http://www.star.bris.ac.uk/~mbt/stilts/) tool is
used in manipulating VOTable format files.
