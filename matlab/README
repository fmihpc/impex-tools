IMPEX FMI MATLAB TOOLS

IMPEx-FMI-Matlab -- Matlab functions for retrieving space simulation
data from the web services provided by the Finnish Meteorological
Institute.

---- How to start --------------------------------------------------------

The fastest way of getting started is to run one of the example
scripts, then look at the script code and start modifying it to your
taste. The example scripts are extensively commented.

To get full listing of the required and optional parameters of each
function, type help <functionName> on your Matlab command line. The
functions are listed below in the section 'Contents: Functions'.

This package includes functions callSoapService.m and
createSoapMessage.m, which have been taken from the Matlab-Fast-Soap
library written by Edo Frederix. The functions are redistributed here,
with slight modifications, as allowed by the free software GNU General
Public License. For more information on Matlab-Fast-Soap, see the
included file <readme_Matlab-Fast-Soap.txt>.

  
---- Contents: Examples --------------------------------------------------

example1_simpledata.m
	Shows how to retrieve and plot data at user-chosen data points and planes.
	Uses getMostRelevantRun, makeCoordinateVotable, getDataPointValue, getSurface.

example2_spacecraft.m
	Shows how to retrieve and plot data along a satellite orbit.
	Uses getDataPointValueSpacecraft.

example3_fieldlines.m
	Shows how to retrieve and plot magnetic field lines.
	Uses getMostRelevantRun, getFieldLine, votread.

example4_trajectories.m
	Shows how to retrieve and plot particle trajectories in the magnetic field of a simulation.
	Uses getMostRelevantRun, makeParticleVotable, getParticleTrajectory, votread.
	
example5_spectra.m	
	Shows how to retrieve and plot particle spectra from the hybrid simulations, either at user-specified points or along a spacecraft trajectory.
	Uses makeCoordinateVotable, getDataPointSpectra, getDataPointSpectraSpacecraft, votread.
