Tools developed at the Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI) as part
of the IMPEx (Integrated Medium for Planetary Exploration) project.

The tools provide access to FMI's global space plasma simulation
models for solar systems bodies including the HYB and GUMICS codes.
Data bases of simulation runs from these models are stored on FMI's
online IMPEx servers and Hybrid Web Archive (HWA). The tools developed
in the IMPEx project give users simple interfaces to download
simulation run results with user defined parameter sets.

The latest version of the FMI IMPEx tools can be downloaded at:
